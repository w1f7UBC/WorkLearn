 * Process is a subclass of Thread that can be managed by the discrete event
 * simulation.
 *
 * This is the basis for all functionality required by startProcess and the
 * discrete event model. Each process creates its own thread to run in. These
 * threads are managed by the eventManager and when a Process has completed
 * running is pooled for reuse.
 *
 * LOCKING: All state in the Process must be updated from a synchronized block
 * using the Process itself as the lock object. Care must be taken to never take
 * the eventManager's lock while holding the Process's lock as this can cause a
 * deadlock with other threads trying to wake you from the threadPool.
